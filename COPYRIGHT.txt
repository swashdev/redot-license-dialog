# This is a sample COPYRIGHT.txt file for a Redot Engine project which uses the
# License Dialog for Redot addon.  The first entry marked "Format" contains a
# link to a page which gives details on how this file should be formatted.
# The COPYRIGHT.txt file used by the Redot Engine is also a good
# reference for the formatting of this file.
#
# If the Copyright File parameter in your LicenseDialog starts with "res://",
# indicating that the file is stored as a resource in the game rather than in
# the user's file system, you should take care to export this file with any
# binaries you might compile for your game.  If you have a copy of the
# documentation, it will contain instructions on how you can do this.  If you
# do not have a copy of the documentation, you can find it at the Source link
# below.
#
# You may include the licensing information contained herein (with
# modifications where appropriate) as an attribution notice if you choose to
# use the License Dialog for Redot addon in your game or other project.
# However, as it has been released into the public domain, you are not required
# to do so.
